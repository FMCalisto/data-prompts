## Example 1

Load this data:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIMBCD-UI/sa-uta11-results/main/data/mimbcdui_uta7_uta11_results_curated_abimid_usability.csv

I am a researcher on the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare. I am trying to understand some patterns on my data, which is using the System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure usability. Please create and execute a notebook to analyze the data above, while providing charts and graphs as well as descriptions of trends and usability issues. The purpose is to tell a story of how clinicians are using AI systems in their daily work. Please remember that I am not experienced with data analysis. Therefore, include text descriptions in the notebook explaining to me what you are doing and shy it is important in a way that is accessible.
